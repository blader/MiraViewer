MiraViewer (Offline) — Quick Start

1) Unzip this folder somewhere (Desktop is fine).
2) Start MiraViewer:
   - macOS: double-click start.command
   - Windows: double-click start.bat
   - Linux: run start.sh
3) Your default web browser should open automatically.
4) Keep the Terminal / Command Prompt window open while using MiraViewer.
   Closing it will stop MiraViewer.

Notes
- No server is required (MiraViewer runs entirely in your browser).
- Your scans are stored locally in your browser on this computer (IndexedDB).
- Use the in-app Download button to export a backup ZIP.

Troubleshooting
- If the window closes immediately or nothing happens, you likely need Python 3 installed.
  Install Python 3 from python.org, then try again.
